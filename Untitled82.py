# Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?
# 

# A class and its instances have a one-to-many relationship, meaning that a class can have multiple instances or objects associated with it.

# Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?
# 

# The data held only in an instance is specific to that particular instance and not shared with other instances. It represents the unique characteristics or values associated with that instance.

# Q3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?
# 

# A class stores general knowledge or information that is shared among all instances. It defines the common properties and behaviors that instances will have. It acts as a blueprint for creating objects and encapsulates essential information and functionality related to a specific concept or entity.

# Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?
# 

# A method is a function specific to a class or object, defining actions it can perform and accessing/modifying its data. Regular functions are standalone and not tied to a specific class or object.

# Q5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?
# 

# class ChildClass(ParentClass):

# Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?

# Python supports encapsulation through naming conventions, indicating private variables and methods with an underscore prefix (_). However, access control is not strictly enforced, relying on programmers to respect the conventions.

# Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?
# 

# class variables are shared among all instances and are accessible using both the class and instances, while instance variables are specific to each instance and can only be accessed through instances.

# Q8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class's method definitions?
# 

# 
# The self parameter is included in class method definitions to refer to the instance of the class itself. It allows access to instance variables and calling other methods within the class. It is typically included in all instance method definitions

# Q9. What is the difference between the _ _add_ _ and the _ _radd_ _ methods?
# 

# '__add__' is for handling addition when the object is on the left side, while __radd__ is for handling addition when the object is on the right side and the left side does not support the addition operation.

# Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?
# 

# 
# Reflection methods, like __getattr__ and __setattr__, are used to customize attribute access and behavior. You need to use reflection methods when you want to handle attributes dynamically or perform additional operations. If you don't require any special handling, you can simply access and modify attributes without using reflection methods.

# Q11. What is the _ _iadd_ _ method called?
# 

# 
# The __iadd__ method is called when the += operator is used for in-place addition on an object. It allows the object to define its behavior when += is used.

# Q12. Is the _ _init_ _ method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass?
# 

# the __init__ method is inherited by subclasses. If you need to customize its behavior within a subclass, you can override it by defining a new __init__ method in the subclass and call the parent class's __init__ method using super().__init__(...). This allows you to add specific initialization steps in the subclass while retaining the common initialization logic from the parent class.
